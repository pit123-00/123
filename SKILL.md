# First Principles Framework (FPF)

An "Operating System for Thought" — a transdisciplinary architecture for reasoning,
written in human- and machine-readable pseudo-code. FPF turns raw intelligence (human or machine)
into organisationally usable reasoning: explicit bounded contexts, auditable artefacts, multi-view
descriptions, and disciplined hand-offs between specialised actors.

## Use cases

Use FPF whenever you need to think more rigorously than the situation's default.

- Decompose a messy, cross-domain problem into parts that can be reasoned about independently
- Make a high-stakes decision with incomplete evidence — and know what evidence is still missing
- Get a mixed team to reason together without vocabulary collisions or hidden assumptions
- Audit whether a conclusion is well-founded or just plausible
- Transfer an insight across domains without losing precision or introducing category errors
- Structure a proposal that must survive scrutiny from multiple expert perspectives
- Generate alternatives systematically instead of anchoring on the first idea
- Define what "better" means before comparing options

## How to navigate

The use cases above help decide WHETHER to invoke FPF. The router below decides WHERE to go once invoked.

### Step 1 — Match the thinking need to a starting point

| What you need to do | Start here |
|---|---|
| **Decompose** a complex whole into bounded parts | 04 Kernel → A.1 Holons, A.1.1 Bounded Contexts, A.14 Mereology |
| **Assign** roles and responsibilities | 04 Kernel → A.2 Roles, A.15 Role-Method-Work Alignment |
| **Set boundaries** on what statements mean | 05 Signature Stack → classify as definitions, gates, duties, or evidence |
| **Prevent category errors** (role vs. function, method vs. work) | 06 Constitutional Principles → A.7 Strict Distinction |
| **Evaluate confidence** in a claim or artifact | 07 Part B → B.3 Trust & Assurance; 08 Part C → C.2 F-G-R scoring |
| **Compose** parts into wholes preserving properties | 07 Part B → B.1 Gamma algebra; 08 Part C → C.13 Compose-CAL |
| **Reason through** a problem systematically | 07 Part B → B.5 Reasoning Cycle, B.5.2 Abductive Loop |
| **Generate alternatives** / explore solution space | 08 Part C → C.18 NQD Open-Ended Search, C.19 Explore-Exploit |
| **Measure and compare** options rigorously | 06 A.V → A.17-A.19 Characteristics & CSLC; 08 Part C → C.16 MM-CHR |
| **Score knowledge** quality (formality, scope, reliability) | 08 Part C → C.2 KD-CAL, C.2.2 Reliability, C.2.3 Formality |
| **Resolve conflicts** across stakeholders or values | 09 Part D → Ethics & Conflict |
| **Unify vocabulary** across teams or domains | 13 F.I Context of Meaning → 14-15 UTS tables → 20 Lexical Debt |
| **Document** for multiple audiences | 11 E-I Constitution → E.17 Multi-View Publication Kit |
| **Survey a discipline** and build a reusable toolkit | 16 Part G → SoTA Packs, TraditionCards, OperatorCards |
| **Trace provenance** of a claim | 06 A.V → A.10 Evidence Graph; 16 Part G → G.6 Provenance Ledger |

For complex problems, follow paths across multiple sections — the router shows where to start, not where to stop.

### Step 2 — Read the _index.md, then the sub-section

1. Open the `_index.md` of the target section folder — it lists all sub-sections with line counts and descriptions.
2. Read only the specific sub-section file you need.
3. Do NOT load entire sections. Pick the narrowest file that serves the user's question.

### Step 3 — Apply in plain language

Use plain language for the user. Introduce FPF-internal names (U.Holon, Gamma, F-G-R)
only when they add precision the user needs.

### Step 4 — Compose findings across sections

When a problem draws from multiple sections:

1. State each pattern's contribution in one line (e.g., "Bounded Contexts gives us the parts; Trust Calculus scores our confidence in each").
2. If patterns from different sections appear to conflict, check for category errors via A.7 Strict Distinction — the conflict is usually a level confusion (role vs. function, method vs. work), not a real contradiction.
3. Synthesize in natural order: decomposition first (what are the parts?), then evaluation (how confident are we?), then resolution (what do we do about gaps?).
4. Do not just list FPF patterns — weave them into a coherent answer to the user's actual question.

## Starter prompt (example — adapt to the user's actual role and need)

> You have the FPF specification loaded.
> Help me structure my project / problem / programme.
> Use plain language for an engineer-manager.
> Propose: (1) bounded contexts / specialisations, (2) decision criteria, (3) key alternatives,
> (4) hand-offs, and (5) missing evidence or tests before commitment.
> Introduce internal FPF names only when they add precision.

## Section INDEX

Structural reference. Each entry is a folder — read its `_index.md` first, then pick the sub-section.
